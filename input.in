Hey, how’s your day going so far?
Did you end up trying that new bakery on the corner?
Wanna grab a bite to eat together after class? I know a great noodle place nearby.
Are you feeling alright? You seem a little off today.
Sorry I forgot to text you back last night—I passed out right after work.
No rush at all—take your time with the report, I can wait till tomorrow.
Have you seen the weather today? It’s pouring rain outside!
I’m thinking of cleaning my room this weekend—wanna come help? I’ll buy you snacks.
Wait, did I hear you right? You’re moving to the city next month?
Thanks for letting me borrow your charger—you saved my life today!
/bye
